# UserManagementApi

This project is a minimal ASP.NET Core Web API built with custom middleware for error handling, authentication, and logging.  
It includes CRUD operations for managing users with fields like Id, Name, and Role.  
Authentication is implemented using a simple token-based middleware.  
The `.http` file allows easy testing of all API endpoints with the required authorization header.
