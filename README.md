# UserManagementApi

A lightweight User Management API built with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs, showcasing clean functional design.  
Activity 1 covers basic CRUD operations with in-memory storage, while Activity 2 adds validation, consistent error handling.  
Activity 3 introduces custom middleware for error handling, token-based authentication, and request/response logging.  
The project uses a simple, organized folder structure with top‑level statements and production-style middleware components.
